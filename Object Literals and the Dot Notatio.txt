Object Literals and the Dot Notation
By the end of this reading, you'll be able to:

Explain one of the three common ways to build objects ( using the object literal notation)

Outline the common way to add new properties to  objects (or update existing properties) using the dot notation


Object literals and the dot notation
One of the most common ways of building an object in JavaScript is using the object literal syntax: {}.

To be able to access this object literal, it is very common to assign it to a variable, such as:

1
var user = {}; //create an object
Now an object literal is assigned to the variable user, which means that the object it is bound to can be extended and manipulated in a myriad of ways.

Sometimes, an entire object can be immediately built, using the object literal syntax, by specifying the object's properties, delimited as key-value pairs, using syntax that was already covered in an earlier lesson item in this lesson.

Here's one such previously built object:

123456789
//creating an object with properties and their values
var assistantManager = {
    rangeTilesPerTurn: 3,
    socialSkills: 30,
    streetSmarts: 30,
    health: 40,
    specialAbility: "young and ambitious",
    greeting: "Let's make some money"
}
The beauty of this syntax is that it's so easily readable. 

It essentially consists of two steps: 

1. Declaring a new variable and assigning an object literal to it - in other words, this: var assistantManager = {} 

2. Assigning the values to each of the object's keys, using the assignment operator, =

Notice that it's very easy to build any kind of an object in JavaScript using this example syntax.

For example, here's a table object:

12345
var table = {
    legs: 3,
    color: "brown",
    priceUSD: 100,
}
To access the table object, I can simply console log the entire object:  

1
console.log(table);//display the object in the developer console
The returned value is the entire table object:  

1
{legs: 3, color: 'brown', priceUSD: 100}
Additionally, I can console log any individual property, like this:  

1
console.log(table.color); // 'brown'
Now that I have this "syntax recipe", I can build any other object in a similar way: 

12345
var house = {
    rooms: 3,
    color: "brown",
    priceUSD: 10000,
}
An alternative approach of building objects is to first save an empty object literal to a variable, then use the dot notation to declare new properties on the fly, and use the assignment operator to add values to those properties; for example:

var house2 = {};
house2.rooms = 4;
house2.color = "pink";
house2.priceUSD = 12345;
Additionally, nothing is preventing me from combining the two approaches. For example:  

123
console.log(house); // {rooms: 3, color: "brown", priceUSD: 10000}
house.windows = 10;
console.log(house); // {rooms: 3, color: "brown", priceUSD: 10000, windows: 10}
This flexbility additionally means that I can update already existing properties, not just add new ones:
