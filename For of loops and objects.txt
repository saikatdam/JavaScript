For of loops and objects
In this reading, you'll learn how the for of loop works conceptually.

To begin, it's important to know that a for of loop cannot work on an object directly, since an object is not iterable. For example:

12345678
const car = {
    speed: 100,
    color: "blue"
}

for(prop of car) {
    console.log(prop)
}
Reset
Running the above code snippet will throw the following error:  

1
Uncaught TypeError: car is not iterable
Contrary to objects, arrays are iterable. For example:  

1234
const colors = ['red','orange','yellow']
for (var color of colors) {
    console.log(color);
}
Reset
This time, the output is as follows:  

123
red
orange
yellow
Luckily, you can use the fact that a for of loop can be run on arrays to loop over objects.

But how?

Before you can properly answer this question, you first need to review three built-in methods: Object.keys(), Object.values(), and Object.entries().

Built-in methods
The Object.keys() method
The Object.keys() method receives an object as its parameter. Remember, this object is the object you want to loop over. It's still too early to explain how you'll loop over the object itself; for now, focus on the returned array of properties when you call the Object.keys() method.

Here's an example of running the Object.keys() method on a brand new car2 object:

12345
const car2 = {
    speed: 200,
    color: "red"
}
console.log(Object.keys(car2)); // ['speed','color']
Reset
So, when I run Object.keys() and pass it my car2 object, the returned value is an array of strings, where each string is a property key of the properties contained in my car2 object.

The Object.values() method
Another useful method is Object.values():

12345
const car3 = {
    speed: 300,
    color: "yellow"
}
console.log(Object.values(car3)); // [300, 'yellow']
The Object.entries() method
Finally, there's another useful method, Object.entries(), which returns an array listing both the keys and the values.  

12345
const car4 = {
    speed: 400,
    color: 'magenta'
}
console.log(Object.entries(car4));
What gets returned from the invocation of the Object.entries() method is the following:  

1
[ ['speed', 400], ['color', 'magenta'] ]
This time, the values that get returned are 2-member arrays nested inside an array. In other words, you get an array of arrays, where each array item has two members, the first being a property's key, and the second being a property's value.

Effectively, it's as if you was listing all of a given object's properties, a bit like this:

12345
[
    [propertyKey, propertyVal],
    [propertyKey, propertyVal],
    ...etc
]
To summarise, you learned that you can loop over arrays using the for of loop.  You also learned that you can extract object's keys, values, or both, using the Object.keys(), Object.values() and Object.entries() syntax.

Examples
You now have all the ingredients that you need to loop over any object's own property keys and values.

Here's a very simple example of doing just that:

12345678910
var clothingItem = {
    price: 50,
    color: 'beige',
    material: 'cotton',
    season: 'autumn'
}

for( const key of Object.keys(clothingItem) ) {
    console.log(key, ":", clothingItem[key])
}
The trickiest part to understand in this syntax is probably the clothingItem[key].

Luckily, this is not too hard to comprehend, especially since you've already covered the concept previously when you were learning how to access an object's member using the brackets notation. 

Recall that you also learned how you can dynamically access a property name.

To revisit this concept and show a practical demo of how that works, let's code a function declaration that randomly assigns either the string speed or the string color to a variable name, and then build an object that has only two keys: a speed key and a color key.

After this setup, you will be able to dynamically access either one of those properties on a brand new drone object, using the brackets notation.

Here's the example's code:

12345678910111213141516
function testBracketsDynamicAccess() {
  var dynamicKey;
  if(Math.random() > 0.5) {
    dynamicKey = "speed";
   }else{
     dynamicKey = "color";
   }

    var drone = {
      speed: 15,

Reset
This example might feel a bit convoluted, but its purpose is to demo the fact that you're getting either one or the other value from an object's key, based on the string that got assigned to the dynamicKey variable, and accessed without issues, using the brackets notation.

Feel free to run the testBracketsDynamicAccess() function a few times, and you'll notice that sometimes the value that gets output is 15, and sometimes it's orange, although I'm always accessing the drone[dynamicKey] key. Since the value of the dynamicKey is populated on the Math.random() invocation, sometimes that expression evaluates to drone["speed"], and other times that expression evaluates to drone["color"].


You have now learned about the building blocks that make the for of loop useful to iterate over objects - although objects are not iterables. 

Next, you'll have a go at a practical example of working with both the for of and the for in loop. Each loops have their place and can be considered useful in different situations.
